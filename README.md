# SPAFramework
One more SPA Framework

Here you have to folders '**application**' and '**common**'

Now i build SPAFramework and build little application on that framework

If you have interest in framework - open 'common' folder,
if you want to look on applicationa wich will build by that framework - open 'application' folder.

Sorry for my bad English (i will fix it **ASAP**).
